# Incident Management

## Overview

This is how CISD will work with Portfolios in order to call and manage Incidents, and manage post-Incident reporting and reviews. It will discuss policies and standards, and most importantly, roles and responsibilities.

This section will describe the MVP, or 'Service Offering', for Incident Management that CISD will provide for Portfolios. Presumably it will include provision for out-of-hours cover, and it will be designed to be scalable in a way that CISD can be sure to have the resources and skills required to deliver the Service.

This initial MVP does not need to achieve the final objectives that CISD might like to have as goals, it should probably leave responsibility for Incident Management with the Portfolios and position CISD as observers, auditors of process, and collectors of reports and collateral.
