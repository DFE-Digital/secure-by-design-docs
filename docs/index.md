# Welcome

Welcome to the Department for Education (DfE)'s Secure by Design (SbD) documentation site.

## Overview

The SbD team sits within the Cyber and Information Security Division (CISD). We will use this site to outline and develop plans for how CISD and digital portfolios will interact with the SbD process.

The portfolios are responsible for achieving and proving SbD compliance to get approval for project funding from the Central Digital and Data office (CDDO). 

We'll include information on this site about how CISD will support portfolios through the SbD process.
