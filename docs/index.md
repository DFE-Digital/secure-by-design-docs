# Welcome

Welcome to the Department for Education (DfE)'s Secure by Design (SbD) site for development documentation.

## Overview

The <abbr title= "Secure by Design">SbD</abbr> team sits within the Cyber and Information Security (CIS) division. We will use this site to outline and develop plans for how the <abbr title = "Cyber and Information Security">CIS</abbr> division and digital portfolios will interact with the <abbr title= "Secure by Design">SbD</abbr> process.

The portfolios are responsible for achieving and proving <abbr title= "Secure by Design">SbD</abbr> compliance to get approval for project funding from the Central Digital and Data office (CDDO). 

We'll include information on this site about how the <abbr title = "Cyber and Information Security">CIS</abbr> division will support portfolios through the <abbr title= "Secure by Design">SbD</abbr> process.
