# Welcome

Welcome to the Department for Education Secure-by-Design development documentation.

## Overview

This is where the SBD team in CISD are going to build out the plans for how CISD and the digital Portfolios will interact with the SBD process.

The Portfolios are responsible for achieving and proving SBD compliance in order to get approval for project funding from CDDO. 

This site describes how CISD will support the Portfolios through that process.
