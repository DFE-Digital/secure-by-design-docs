# Implementing a vulnerability management process

The [CDDO implementing a vulnerability management process activity section](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/secure-by-design/activities/implementing-a-vulnerability-management-process/) outlines how you should deal with vulnerabilities during your development lifecycle.

DfE CISD has produced guides on:

* [how to triage vulnerabilities](../Vulnerability%20Management/how_to_triage_vulnerabilities.md)
* [assessing risks](../Vulnerability%20Management/assessing_risks.md)
* [escalation processes](../Vulnerability%20Management/escalation_processes.md)

## Roles and responsibilities

### Service teams and portfolios

It is the service teams and portfolios responsibility to produce secure digital services and to follow good practices when building their services.

Part of building digital services is to ensure that potential vulnerabilities are found and fixed within reasonable timeframes to reduce the risk to the service and data. 

Vulnerability management processes should be followed to ensure discovered issues are fixed in a timely manner and within DfE SLAs to ensure you minimise the risk to DfE systems and data.

### CISD

It is CISDs responsibility to provide support and guidance to digital service teams and portfolios in mitigation planning, vulnerability tracking and risk management. 

CISD will:

* provide guidance on assessing risks
* provide guidance on managing vulnerabilities
* provide guidance on escalation processes
* provide mitigation plan assistance 
* provide vulnerability management for critical issues
* run a [Vulnerability Disclosure Programme](../Vulnerability%20Management/vulnerability_disclosure_programme.md) for external security researchers
* run vulnerability scans for virtual machines in Azure
