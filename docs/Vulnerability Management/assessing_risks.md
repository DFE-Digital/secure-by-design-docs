# Assessing Risks
Assessing risks is an important activity when building secure software, it should be used to help prioritise work on fixing vulnerabilities, and to highlight risks to the system that have not yet been resolved. When assessing vulnerabilities, you will generally consider the impact should the vulnerability be exploited, against the likelihood the vulnerability will/could be exploited.

If there is an ISO assigned to your team, you should work with them to make sure you are assessing the risks associated with your service on a regular basis and that you are tracking risks that are unresolved appropriately.


## Risk assessment methods
The [NCSC basic risk assessment and management method](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/risk-management/a-basic-risk-assessment-and-management-method) is a good framework for assessing the risks to your service.


## Risk registers
Each service team should maintain a risk register that tracks the associated risks to their service. This can be done in the [spreadsheet TBC]() and should be shared and reported with the assigned ISO.
