# Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP)

# Vulnerability Disclosure Programme
The [vulnerability disclosure program (VDP)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/vulnerability-disclosure-toolkit) is a project that DfE has been onboarding to with the help of NCSC. It involves a toolkit designed to help us make it easier for security researchers to contact the correct teams to report vulnerabilities they've discovered.

All information on [how to report a vulnerability to DfE as part of the VDP](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-a-vulnerability-on-a-department-for-education-system) have been posted to our GOV.UK site.

To make reporting vulnerabilities easier, the toolkit suggests:

* forms of communication -  we have a Hackerone vulnerability disclosure link that goes directly to the vulnerability management (VM) team
* a clear policy on what we expect from someone reporting a vulnerability and how we will respond
* a security.txt file that can be published for all web services at the standard location (`/.well-known`) – DfE’s Cyber and Information Security division (CISD) have deployed a security.txt file linking to our communication options and also a thanks.txt file that gives acknowledgements to researchers


Security.txt file: [https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt](https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt)

Thanks.txt file: [https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/thanks.txt](https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/thanks.txt)


The idea is based on the [GDS/Cabinet Office centrally hosted PaaS project for VDP](https://github.com/alphagov/security.txt). As PaaS has been decommissioned, this project will be hosted on an Azure Storage static site.

## Digital Service Secure by Design responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the digital service teams to ensure that they are:

* discover vulnerabilities
* manage observability
* implement vulnerability management processes

The Vulnerability Disclosure Programme helps teams to achieve these activities by providing a simple, standardised way for security researchers to report vulnerabilities in applications. The vulnerability management team will follow a quick and simple triage process to ensure the vulnerability is raised to the team for fixing as soon as possible.

## How to sign up for DfE's VDP

### Security.txt redirection

To take advantage of the disclosure and triaging of vulnerabilities, digital services can set the origin or submit a 308 redirect to the centrally hosted security.txt when they attempt to browse to the "standard location" for a security.txt file.

For example:

If a user on your site attempts to browse to `https://your-app/.well-known/security.txt` or `https://your-app/security.txt` then set the origin or do a 308 redirect to `https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt`.

Likewise, if they attempt to browse to `https://your-app/thanks.txt` then set the origin or do a 308 redirect to `https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/thanks.txt`.

### Example Terraform configuration
If you are using Terraform, you could create a CDN rule similar to the following:

```
resource "azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_rule" "security_txt_rule" {

  depends_on = [<DOMAINS/ORIGINS>]
  name                      = "securitytxtredirect"
  cdn_frontdoor_rule_set_id = azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_rule_set.<ruleset_name>.id
  order                     = 1
  behavior_on_match         = "Continue"

  actions {

    url_redirect_action {
      redirect_type        = "PermanentRedirect"
      redirect_protocol    = "Https"
      destination_hostname = "vdp.security.education.gov.uk"
      destination_path     = "/.well-known/security.txt"
    }
  }

  conditions {
    url_filename_condition {
      operator         = "BeginsWith"
      match_values     = ["security.txt", "/.well-known/security.txt"]
      transforms       = ["Lowercase"]
    }
  }
}
```

A good example of a service implementing the above terraform redirect can be found on the [teacher services terraform module repo security rules](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/terraform-modules/blob/main/domains/environment_domains/front_door_security_rules.tf).


## Ensure the VM team have your current contact information
To make sure that the VM team can contact the right people in your team within a reasonable time period after a disclosure has been sent in, we ask that you provide a group email address to [vulnerability.management@education.gov.uk](mailto:vulnerability.management@education.gov.uk) so you can be contacted regardless of leavers/joiners processes. 

## Contributing to the security.txt or thanks.txt
The security.txt and thanks.txt files are deployed through Terraform to Azure Storage Blobs as a static site.

Raise a Pull Request (PR) against the repository if you want to suggest improvements to the files or deployment. A member of CISD will review and approve PRs, which will trigger a GitHub Actions pipeline to redeploy the changes.

If a security researcher has requested a bounty, ensure you state that we do not provide monetary bounties but will be happy to list their name under [our acknowledgements page](https://vdp.security.education.gov.uk/thanks.txt) (`thanks.txt`). This can be done whether the notification was through the VDP or not. You can either request the change from the VM team or raise a PR directly.

## Contributing
Refer to [our GitHub repo contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to raise a bug or pull request to the security.txt or thanks.txt.
